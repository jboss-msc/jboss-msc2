    <H1>Introduction</H1>
    <P>
      Before <B>Service</B> is put into service its associated <B>Service Controller</B> must be successfully installed into <B>MSC2</B> runtime.
      <B>Service Controller</B> keeps all necessary information such as its <U>primary registration</U>, optional <U>alias registrations</U>
      and optional <U>dependencies</U> referencing dependency registrations.
    </P>
    <H2>Definitions</H2>
    <H3>1.1 Service Controller Installation</H3>
    <P>
      <B>Service Controller Installation</B> is a <U>sequence undivisible process</U> executed from single thread.
      Such single thread will be called <B>service installing thread</B>.
      <B>Service Controller Installation</B> process consists of the following phases executed in this order:
      <OL>
        <LI>
          <B>Controller Registration Phase</B> - consists of associating controller with <U>required primary registration</U> and with 
          <U>optional alias registrations</U>. The association with registration is atomic operation. Association of controller with either
          primary or alias registration will fail if and only if there is already associated controller with the registration. This failure
          process is fast fail i.e. on first failure currently executing <B>Controller Registration Phase</B> will be immediately terminated,
          the second <B>Cycle Detection Phase</B> will be omitted and <B>Controller Unregistration Phase</B> will be initiated.
          Upon <B>Controller Deregistration Phase</B> completion <B>DuplicateServiceException</B> will be thrown.
        </LI>
        <LI>
          <B>Cycle Detection Phase</B> - verifies whether succesfully installed <B>Service Controller</B> in previous phase didn't introduce a 
          <U>dependencies cycle</U>. This phase is completely omitted if there was a <U>duplicit service</U> installation attempt detected in previous step.
          If <U>dependencies cycle</U> containing currently installed <B>Service Controller</B> is detected then currently executing <B>Cycle Detection Phase</B> will be immediately terminated and 
          <B>Controller Deregistration Phase</B> will be initiated. Upon <B>Controller Deregistration Phase</B> completion <B>CircularDependencyException</B> will be thrown.
        </LI>
        <LI>
          <B>Controller Unregistration Phase</B> - rolls back all successful controller registration associations achieved in <B>Controller Registration Phase</B>.
          Controller unregistration is atomic operation that associates <B>null</B> with all affected registrations.
          This phase is executed if either <B>Controller Registration Phase</B> detected an attempt to install <U>duplicit service</U>
          or if <U>dependencies cycle</U> was detected at <B>Cycle Detection Phase</B>. This phase is omitted if and only if both
          previous phases were successfully completely executed. This last phase if executed can never fail.
        </LI>
      </OL>
    </P>
    <H3>1.2 Service Controller Removal</H3>
    <P>
      <B>Service Controller Removal</B> is an <U>undivisible process</U> executed from single thread.
      Such thread will be called <B>service removing thread</B>.
      <B>Service Controller Removal</B> can be executed if and only if there was a successful preceding <B>Service Controller Installation</B>.
      <B>Service Controller Removal</B> process consists of single phase:
      <OL>
        <LI>
          <B>Controller Removal Phase</B> - associates <B>null</B> with all registrations referencing currently removing controller.
        </LI>
      </OL>
    </P>
    <H3>1.3 Dependencies Service Graph</H3>
    <P>
      <U>Dependencies Cycle Detection Algorithm</U> will operate on
      <B>Dependencies Service Graph</B> whose representation is as follows:
      <UL>
        <LI><U>Service Controllers</U> represent <B>vertices</B>. Vertices have unique names.</LI>
        <LI><U>Dependencies</U> represent <B>edges</B>.</LI>
      </UL>
      In current implementation, <U>Dependencies</U> reference <U>Registrations</U>,
      but registrations have a 1 to 1 mapping to controllers. If registration
      has no associated controller with it, we will say such vertex is <U>UNDEFINED</U>.
      If registration has associated controller, we will say such vertex is <U>DEFINED</U>.
      Both <U>UNDEFINED</U> and <U>DEFINED</U> vertices are part of
      <B>Dependencies Service Graph</B> representation.
      We can distinguish them by e.g. two different colours.
    </P>
    <H3>1.4 Dependencies Service Graph Construction</H3>
    <P>
      <B>Dependencies Service Graph</B> can be and many times will be updated concurrently.
      We define two possible atomic <U>update operations</U> on it:
      <UL>
        <LI><U>Service Controller Installation</U> - installs service controller into MSC2 runtime (including its aliases and dependencies if any)
        <LI><U>Service Controller Removal</U> - removes service controller from MSC2 runtime (including its aliases and dependencies if any)
      </UL>
      At the beginning there is always an <U>empty graph</U>.
    </P>
    <P>
      If service <B>A</B> with aliases <B>A1, ..., An</B> without dependencies is installed into <U>empty graph</U> <B>G</B>,
      we will add new <U>DEFINED</U> vertex <B>A</B> for service name
      and also new <U>DEFINED</U> vertices <B>A1, ..., An</B> for every service alias into <B>G</B>.
    </P>
    <P>
      If service <B>A</B> with aliases <B>A1, ..., An</B> and with dependencies <B>D1, ..., Dm</B> is installed into <U>empty graph</U> <B>G</B>,
      we will add new <U>DEFINED</U> vertex <B>A</B> for service name
      and new <U>DEFINED</U> vertices <B>A1, ..., An</B> for every service alias into <B>G</B>.
      Next we will add new <U>UNDEFINED</U> vertices <B>D1, ..., Dm</B> into <B>G</B>.
      Finally we will add the following edges into <B>G</B>:<BR/>
      A -&gt; D1, ..., A -&gt; Dm</BR>
      A1 -&gt; D1, ..., A1 -&gt; Dm<BR/>
      A2 -&gt; D1, ..., A2 -&gt; Dm<BR/>
      ...<BR/>
      An -&gt; D1, ..., An -&gt; Dm<BR/>
    </P>
    <P>
      If service <B>A</B> with aliases <B>A1, ..., An</B> without dependencies is installed into <U>non empty graph</U> <B>G</B>, we will:
      <UL>
        <LI>switch every existing vertex <B>Ai</B> from <U>UNDEFINED</U> to <U>DEFINED</U> state in graph <B>G</B>: <B>Ai</B> from <B>{ A, A1, ..., An }</B>.
        <LI>create new <U>DEFINED</U> vertices <B>Ai</B>, if <B>Ai</B> was not present in <B>G</B>: <B>Ai</B> from <B>{ A, A1, ..., An }</B>
      </UL>
    </P>
    <P>
      If service <B>A</B> with aliases <B>A1, ..., An</B> with dependencies <B>D1, ...., Dm</B> is installed into <U>non empty graph</U> <B>G</B>, we will:
      <UL>
        <LI>switch every existing vertex <B>Ai</B> from <U>UNDEFINED</U> to <U>DEFINED</U> state in graph <B>G</B>: <B>Ai</B> from <B>{ A, A1, ..., An }</B></LI>
        <LI>add new <U>DEFINED</U> vertices <B>Ai</B>, if <B>Ai</B> was not present in <B>G</B>: <B>Ai</B> from <B>{ A, A1, ..., An }</B></LI>
        <LI>add new <U>UNDEFINED</U> vertices <B>Dj</B>, if <B>Dj</B> was not present in <B>G</B>: <B>Dj</B> from <B>{ D1, ..., Dm }</B></LI>
        <LI>Finally add the following edges into <B>G</B>:<BR/>
      A -&gt; D1, ..., A -&gt; Dm</BR>
      A1 -&gt; D1, ..., A1 -&gt; Dm<BR/>
      A2 -&gt; D1, ..., A2 -&gt; Dm<BR/>
      ...<BR/>
      An -&gt; D1, ..., An -&gt; Dm<BR/>
        </LI>
      </UL>
    </P>
    <P>
      If service <B>A</B> with aliases <B>A1, ..., An</B> with dependencies <B>D1, ...., Dm</B> is removed from <U>non empty graph</U> <B>G</B>, we will:
      <UL>
        <LI>remove the following edges from <B>G</B>:<BR/>
      A -&gt; D1, ..., A -&gt; Dm</BR>
      A1 -&gt; D1, ..., A1 -&gt; Dm<BR/>
      A2 -&gt; D1, ..., A2 -&gt; Dm<BR/>
      ...<BR/>
      An -&gt; D1, ..., An -&gt; Dm<BR/>
        <LI>Finally switch all vertices <B>Ai</B> from <U>DEFINED</U> to <U>UNDEFINED</U> state in graph <B>G</B>: <B>Ai</B> from <B>{ A, A1, ..., An }</B></LI>

    <H2>2 Proposition</H2>
    <P>
      Let's assume there will be a <U>dependencies cycle</U> created in <B>Dependencies Service Graph</B> and there will be no <B>service removing thread</B> 
      that would eliminate the cycle concurrently. Such <U>dependencies cycle</U> will be eliminated shortly by at least one <B>service installing thread</B>
      that participated on its creation. Further more such <B>service installing thread</B> will throw an exception upon <B>Controller Unregistration Phase</B> completion.
    </P>
    <P>
      <B>Proof.</B> Let's say <U>dependencies cycle</U> was created at time <B>t_cc</B> in <B>Dependencies Service Graph</B>.
      The fact cycle was created means there exists a path <B>C = { V_1, V_2, ..., V_n, V_1 }</B> at time <B>t_cc</B>.
      For every <B>V_i: i = 1, ..., n</B> exists an <U>service installing thread</U> <B>T_i</B> that created it.
      Let's mark <B>T_cc</B> an <B>service installing thread</B> that created <B>V_1</B> - the vertex causing a cycle.
      Let's assume none <B>T_i</B> which created <B>V_i != V_1: i = 1, ..., n</B> will eliminate the cycle. This implies vertices <B>V_i: V_i != V1</B> will be succesfully installed.
      This implies <B>T_i</B>'s <B>Controller Registration Phase</B> and <B>Cycle Detection Phase</B> will be succesfully executed.<BR/><BR/>
      Now let's reason about <B>T_cc</B> in which state it can be at time <B>t_cc</B>.
      Since <B>V_1</B> was succesfully installed this means its <B>Controller Registration Phase</B> was at least partially executed.
      Next are the only two possibilities of <B>T_cc</B>'s execution flow:
      <UL>
        <LI>
          Let's assume both primary <B>P</B> and optional alias registrations  <B>A1, ..., An</B> will be succesfully installed.
          <B>V1</B> represents one of <B>{ P, A1, ..., An }</B> vertices. This implies <B>T_cc</B>'s <B>Controller Registration Phase</B>
          will be succesfully completed. When its <B>Cycle Detection Phase</B> will be executing, it will detect the cycle.
          Once cycle is detected, <B>Cycle Detection Phase</B> will be immediately terminated and <B>service installing thread</B>
          will initiate <B>Controller Unregistration Phase</B>. According to definition above, this phase will <B>UNDEFINE</B>
          all <B>P</B> and <B>A1, ..., An</B> plus it will remove all their outgoing edges. But one of these <B>{ P, A1, ..., An }</B> outgoing edges was participating in the cycle.
          Thus as the final result cycle is eliminated. Later upon <B>Controller Registration Phase</B> completion <B>CircularDependencyException</B> will be thrown.
        </LI>
        <LI>
          Let's assume either primary <B>P</B> or one of alias registrations <B>A1, ..., An</B> will detect <U>duplicit service</U> installation (the only way this phase may fail).
          <B>V1</B> represents one of <B>{ P, A1, ..., An }</B> vertices and it was installed before <U>duplicit service</U> was detected.
          According to definition above, this implies <B>T_cc</B>'s
          <B>Controller Registration Phase</B> will be immediately terminated, its <B>Cycle Detection Phase</B> will be omitted
          and its <B>Controller Registration Phase</B> will be initiated. According to definition above, this third phase will <B>UNDEFINE</B>
          all <B>P</B> and <B>A1, ..., An</B> plus it will remove all their outgoing edges. But one of these <B>{ P, A1, ..., An }</B> outgoing edges was participating in the cycle.
          Thus as the final result cycle is eliminated. Later upon <B>Controller Registration Phase</B> completion <B>DuplicateServiceException</B> will be thrown.
